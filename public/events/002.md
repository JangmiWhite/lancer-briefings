# Evergreen // 4.25.5014u
The group had taken their time in the month following the destruction of **BROADCAST** and **VENOM.** **CERBERUS** had acquired many new resources and friends in a mix of gambling and general partying with the various people in and out of Evergreen. **PATCHWORK** spent their time browsing various interpoint forums around the HORUS net, and while the experience was largely painful and uneventful, it all came to a head when, after a long discussion about the latest season of NuCure, a random member suddenly dropped prototype frame specs which **PATCHWORK** was able to scan and steal, formulating their own blueprints for their own frame that just needs to wait for new materials. **EURYALE** spent their time more inwardly focused, working on learning various new tricks to help them out by making them look cooler, and they were originally intending to show off at the Militia base but found themselves into a very heated arguement about military tactics with a grunt who tried to start a fight with **EURYALE** which ended very poorly for them. Some people found that they were far too brutal in their handling of the situation, requiring **PATIENCE** and **BRAVA** to try and smooth things out with the Milita, which is taking it's time. **MELIFERA** and **ZEE** were able to work together in exploring the old ruined camp of the Raiders they found when they had first fought **VENOM**, **MELIFERA** finding old hardsuit equipment made has a precursor to proper mechanized frames, alongside coming across a few Raiders along the way to investigate the Machine congregation where they learned some valuable information before escaping, leaving traces behind. **ZEE** meanwhile, primarily found more usable mech parts, salvaged from old Union SECCOM era which only continued to grow more major has they approached deeper into the forest, a part where the trees thinned and crators formed.
